# Reality-Gaming
This is an example of Augmented Reality Gaming where online games are played considering the movement of the user.
I used object tracking using opencv for this Project and PyAutoGUI for the key press.
Any game which can be played with Left,Right,Up,Down arrow keys can be played using Object Detection.
Instead of pressing left key manually we can move our detected object to the left using PyAutoGUI and it works similarly for other keys.
There are several trackers in OpenCV to detect objects on the screen,here we have used CSRT tracker which has 25fps but higher accuracy for object detection.
